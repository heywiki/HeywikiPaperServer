== Running

This is a minecraft paper mc docker container

https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper

It copies some default plugins (Mods) and a default server.properties
and ops.json (and other default files) to the data dir before
the server gets started (therefore this container actually defines
the default files, not paper default expansion)

Create a docker volume first

----
docker volume create --name papermc-data
----

Run with

----
docker run -d \
-p 25565:25565 \
--name papermc-server \
-v papermc-data:/data \
-m=4g \
heywiki2/papermc:latest

== Updating Server Version

To update the paper server, download the version of the jar you would like
to use from 

https://papermc.io/downloads

and copy it to the /setup dir. Move the older jar to /etc/attic.

Then change the line in the server-run.sh to the file you just downloaded,
e.g.

----
/opt/minecraft/paper-1.16.5-428.jar nogui \
----

With the following command you can build the container image

----
bash dodev.sh build
----

For more commands see dodev.sh
